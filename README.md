Brute force and sortR algorithm for solving single machine RPQ problem

Tasks are created in loop. Values of R, P and Q are generated randomly for every task.
Computation time for both algorithms available for comparison.

You may want to change:
1. Number of tasks by changing `TASK_COUNT`
2. Minimal time for step by changing `MIN_TIME`
3. Maximal time for step by changing `MAX_TIME`
